# Geographic Information Systems (GIS) \ Geographic Information Science (GISc) Portfolio

This repository serves as a knowledge base for my GIS research and projects for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. The majority of research and projects are done utilizing ArcGIS, Python, and PostgreSQL. Presented in the form of Maps, PDFs of reasearch, and Powepoint presentations.

- __[Wolverine Connectivity Corridor](https://github.com/krevee/GIS-Porfolio/blob/main/Wolverine%20Connectivity%20Corridor/Wolverine%20Connectivity%20Corridor.pdf)__- This map is a wildlife corridor linkage map for the Wolverine (Gulo Gulo) from its current territory in Washington, Oregon and Idaho to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In the past the Wolverine was home range included much of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and from 1922 until 2008 there had been no sightings of the Wolverine in the Sierras. But as of 2016 there has been at least one Wolverine sighted in the Lake Tahoe area. The purpose of this map is to help conservation efforts in the United States that aim to repopulate Wolerines in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

- __[UAS Orthomosaic Imagery Applications](https://github.com/krevee/GIS-Porfolio/blob/main/UAS%20Orthomosaic%20Imagery%20Applications/UAS%20Orthomosaic%20Imagery%20Applications%20Poster.pdf)__- This project aimed to measure the accuracy of orthomosaic imagery acquired from a UAS platform to aide in GIS field research applications. The quality of imagery was tested, and compared to other conventional imagery sources such as satellite and manned aerial platforms. The research was conducted at the Wrigley Marine Institute on Catalina Island by USC students in the GIST Masters Program.

- __[Santa Barbara County Solar Potential](https://github.com/krevee/GIS-Porfolio/blob/main/Santa%20Barbara%20County%20Solar%20Potential/Santa%20Barbara%20County%20Solar%20Potential.pdf)__- The goal of this project was to see what sites in Santa Barbara County would be suitable for PV solar farms to supplement the areas energy needs. I focused on ground mount solar panel plants rather than residential solar panels. I preformed a mulch-criteria evaluation to determine the viability of PV solar plants at varies sites within the Santa Barbara County Border.

- __[Modifiable Areal Unit Problem](https://github.com/krevee/GIS-Porfolio/blob/main/Modifiable%20Areal%20Unit%20Problem/Modifiable%20Areal%20Unit%20Problem.pdf)__- The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem or MAUP, also called the ecological fallacy, is a common issue in geographic and spatial analysis. It is a source of statistical bias that can drastically affect the results of data analysis.
